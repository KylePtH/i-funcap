## What is it?

WIP of unofficial interactive version of [FUNCAP pre-print](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202309.2091/v1) questionnaire for assessing ME/CFS.

## How does it work?

`generate.py` generates individual variants based on `*.template.html` files and language specific questions in `/langs`. Currently very WIP, i.e. most questions are missing, there's no comparison with published cohorts, etc.

Despite being WIP, any PRs welcome!

## Plan (feel free to contribute before I add it)
- finish UI, i.e. add answers properly, general description
- rip all questions for english, and some other language variant
- make it available on githubio domain or maybe under petrroll.cz somewhere?
- add support for generating 55 and 27 questions versions
- show where you fall in the populations reported in the paper
